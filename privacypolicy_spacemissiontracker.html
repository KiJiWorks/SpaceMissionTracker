<p>
Thank you for using Space Mission Tracker ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how KiJi Works ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the App. The App provides information about upcoming rocket launches and is designed to be safe and appropriate for users of all ages, including children. Our goal is to be transparent about our practices.
</p>
<p>
1. No Collection of Personal Information
We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifiable data. The App is designed to provide information about rocket launches without requiring or gathering personal details.
</p>
<p>
2. Advertisements
The App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service. These ads are configured to comply with policies for apps suitable for children, including the use of non-personalized ads where applicable. Google AdMob may collect certain non-personal information, such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), to serve relevant ads. This data collection is handled solely by Google and is subject to their privacy practices.
We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob. For more information about how Google handles data in connection with its advertising services, please review Google’s Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
3. Non-Personal Information
The App may automatically collect certain non-personal information, such as anonymized usage data (e.g., app crashes or performance metrics), to improve the App’s functionality and user experience. This information does not identify you as an individual and is not shared with third parties except as described in this policy.
</p>
<p>
4. Third-Party Services
As noted, the App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may use cookies, device identifiers, or other tracking technologies to deliver ads, but these are configured to align with the App’s suitability for children. These practices are governed by Google’s own policies, and we encourage you to review them.
We do not share any information with other third parties, as we do not collect any personal data.
</p>
<p>
5. Children’s Privacy
Space Mission Tracker is designed to be safe and appropriate for users of all ages, including children under the age of 13. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable laws. We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personal information from any users, including children. The App’s content, which provides information about upcoming rocket launches, and its advertisements are intended to be family-friendly.
If you have any concerns about children’s privacy in relation to the App, please contact us at kijiworks@outlook.com.
